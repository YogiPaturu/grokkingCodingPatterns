/*
Given a string and a pattern, find out if the string contains any permutation of the pattern.

Permutation is defined as the re-arranging of the characters of the string. For example, “abc” has the following six permutations:

abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba
If a string has ‘n’ distinct characters, it will have n!n! permutations.

Example 1:
Input: String="oidbcaf", Pattern="abc"
Output: true
Explanation: The string contains "bca" which is a permutation of the given pattern.

Example 2:
Input: String="odicf", Pattern="dc"
Output: false
Explanation: No permutation of the pattern is present in the given string as a substring.

Example 3:
Input: String="bcdxabcdy", Pattern="bcdyabcdx"
Output: true
Explanation: Both the string and the pattern are a permutation of each other.

Example 4:
Input: String="aaacb", Pattern="abc"
Output: true
Explanation: The string contains "acb" which is a permutation of the given pattern.
